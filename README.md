# Understanding Key API and Software Concepts



## API

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate 1  and exchange data with each other. 2  It acts as a bridge between two applications, enabling them to interact and share functionalities.

## SDK

An SDK (Software Development Kit) is a collection of tools, libraries, and documentation that developers use to build applications for a specific platform or programming language. It provides the necessary resources to streamline the development process, making it easier to create software that interacts with a particular system or service.

# Web APIs

Web APIs are application programming interfaces (APIs) specifically designed for web applications. They typically use HTTP protocols for communication, allowing different web applications to interact and exchange data over the internet. This enables developers to create dynamic, data-driven web applications by accessing and utilizing resources from various sources.

# Library APIs

Library APIs are application programming interfaces (APIs) provided by libraries. These libraries offer pre-written code and functions that developers can incorporate into their applications to perform specific tasks. By using library APIs, developers can save time and effort by leveraging existing code instead of writing everything from scratch. This promotes code reusability and efficiency in software development.

# Prompting and Completion

Prompting and completion is a fundamental interaction with AI models, especially large language models (LLMs). A prompt is the input or instruction given to the model, while the completion is the generated output or response. By providing specific prompts, users can guide the model to generate text, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, and answer questions in an informative way. The 1  effectiveness of the completion depends on the quality and specificity of the prompt.
